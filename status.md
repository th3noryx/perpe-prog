## Round 1: Initial Attack Vector Analysis

### Attack Categories Identified

Based on analysis of `../percolator` and `../percolator-prog`:

#### 1. Oracle Manipulation Attacks
- [ ] Flash loan + oracle spike to extract fake profit
- [ ] Stale oracle exploitation (bypass freshness checks)
- [ ] Oracle price boundary attacks (0, MAX, overflow)

#### 2. Margin/Liquidation Attacks
- [x] Under-margin trade attempts (BLOCKED - Round 1)
- [ ] Liquidation front-running
- [ ] Partial liquidation gaming
- [ ] Dust position attacks (below min_liquidation_abs)

#### 3. Funding Rate Attacks
- [ ] Funding rate manipulation via position imbalance
- [ ] Funding accumulation overflow
- [ ] Lazy settlement exploitation

#### 4. ADL (Auto-Deleveraging) Attacks
- [ ] ADL exclusion epoch wraparound
- [ ] Proportional haircut gaming
- [ ] ADL atomicity exploitation (documented bug)

#### 5. Warmup/PnL Attacks
- [ ] Warmup bypass attempts
- [ ] PnL realization timing attacks
- [ ] Warmup slope manipulation

#### 6. Insurance Fund Attacks
- [ ] Insurance drain via coordinated liquidations
- [x] Insurance floor bypass (VERIFIED - floor enforced)
- [ ] Reserved insurance exploitation

#### 7. Conservation Attacks
- [x] Vault drain attempts (BLOCKED - Round 1)
- [x] Capital extraction beyond deposits (BLOCKED - Round 1)
- [x] Rounding error accumulation (VERIFIED - conservation holds)

#### 8. State Machine Attacks
- [ ] Risk-reduction-only mode bypass
- [ ] Pending socialization race conditions
- [ ] Account close with pending obligations

## Positive Tests (Correctness Verification)

#### Core Invariants
- [ ] I1: ADL never reduces principal
- [x] I2: Conservation of funds (VERIFIED - multiple rounds)
- [ ] I5: Warmup bounded by PnL
- [?] I7: User isolation (NEEDS INVESTIGATION - test setup issue)
- [ ] I10: Risk mode triggers correctly

#### Operational Correctness
- [x] Deposits credited correctly (VERIFIED - Round 1)
- [x] Withdrawals respect margin requirements (VERIFIED - Round 1)
- [ ] Trades execute at correct prices
